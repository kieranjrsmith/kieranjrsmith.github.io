intro: |
  Throughout my undergraduate studies, I was privileged to be taught by incredible tutors who inspired me to achieve a PhD in English Literature. Their determination to help me succeed shaped my own passion for teaching. I now aim to inspire confidence in my students, helping them to enjoy reading and writing critically while achieving their academic goals.

    I offer personalised one-to-one in-person tutoring for students in North and South Lanarkshire who require additional support for their English Nat 5, Higher, Advanced Higher, GCSE and A-Level exams. For students further afield or those who prefer online learning, I also offer video lessons.
    
    My tutoring is tailored to help you overcome specific challenges in English and develop the skills you already possess. I have experience teaching students with special educational needs and am happy to adapt my tutoring to meet individual learning requirements.
