        <div class="intro">
            <p>Throughout my undergraduate studies, I was privileged to be taught by incredible tutors who inspired me to achieve a PhD in English Literature. Their determination to help me succeed shaped my own passion for teaching. I now aim to inspire confidence in my students, helping them to enjoy reading and writing critically while achieving their academic goals.</p>

            <h3><strong>About the Service</strong></h3>
            <p>I offer personalised one-to-one in-person tutoring for students in North and South Lanarkshire who require additional support for their English Nat 5, Higher, Advanced Higher, GCSE and A-Level exams. For students further afield or those who prefer online learning, I also offer video lessons.</p>
            <p>My tutoring is tailored to help you overcome specific challenges in English and develop the skills you already possess. I have experience teaching students with special educational needs and am happy to adapt my tutoring to meet individual learning requirements.</p>

            <p>I also worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at the University of Glasgow for 2 semesters, during which I hosted in-person group seminars and graded student contributions.</p>
